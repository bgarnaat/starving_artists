Code 201 project week project.


Our project entitled "Mic Check" is a website and mobile app that allows our users to search for events around the Seattle area.  More specifically our site's targeted audience is one that includes individuals who enjoy watching live performance, dance, and comedy at a wide range of Seattle venues.  Our site allows our user to search for upcoming shows and venues and also presents the option of listing upcoming events that our user's may be a part of.  There is also the option of adding newly opened or unlisted venues to our database (the site's local storage).  

All of our data is stored in our object.js page which is linked to local storage.  Through a series of constructors and function calls the arrays containing this information are accessed and presented to our users upon submission requests.  When a user adds an upcoming show or newly opened venue, the information is immediately stored in local storage so it can be accessed via our drop down menus on our pages.  

Our site was made with the objective of looking nice and neat across all devices.  We used flex boxes to control the flow of our page and created as much HTML using JavaScript as possible.  Everyone in our group played a part in creating this application.  We interacted and discussed every stage of building this project and used github to share, merge and collaborate our efforts.
